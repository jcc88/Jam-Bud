# Jam-Bud
Applying Machine Learning to music creation with the help of Google's Magenta. Jam Bud aims to take Magenta from a proof-of-concept to a more tangible and useful tool. For now, we focus on doing a demo of Magenta interacting and engaging with the musician.   

## Requirements for demo
Logic Pro X, a synth/controller and a CPU/GPU.

## Installation
Set up the [Magenta Development Environment](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta). 
We are using the ['call and response'](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/interfaces/midi) interface. And once all dependencies are correctly installed. We can begin jamming.


## Demo
Make sure the environment in Logic Pro X is set up correctly. Now open a terminal, and from the magenta workspace you can enter the following script:

## Tweaking the interface
